# In-vivo RNA-binding protein (RBP) affinity prediction

## PLAN

- choose just PUM2
  - simpler use-case
  - just some random model
- use all the features
- follow Johhny's schema
- use batch loading


## TODO

- [ ] implement your pre-processor in python
  - familiarize with the tools like pybedtools etc
- explore how to encapsulate the pre-processor
